export const explosiveAtmospheresPurposeText = `This assessment evaluates the risks arising from explosive atmospheres and dangerous substances associated with processes and activities undertaken at the premises. It identifies hazardous areas, potential ignition sources, and the control measures in place to prevent and mitigate explosion risk.

The assessment methodology follows industry best practice for identifying sources of flammable substance release, evaluating the likelihood and duration of explosive atmosphere formation, and determining appropriate risk control measures. This includes systematic evaluation of process operations, material handling, storage arrangements, and the selection of equipment suitable for use in classified hazardous areas.

The assessment considers both gases and vapours (Group II atmospheres) and combustible dusts, addressing the specific characteristics and control requirements for each. The evaluation encompasses normal operating conditions, maintenance activities, and foreseeable abnormal situations that could lead to the formation of explosive atmospheres.`;
