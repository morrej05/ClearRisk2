Hot work operations have been a significant cause of fire losses in commercial properties, when historical loss data is analysed. These hazardous operations need to be strictly controlled and monitored for both employees and contractors if losses are to be avoided and this is best achieved through the use of a formal permit-to-work procedure.', action: 'Develop a comprehensive hot work, permit to work procedure for use by site personnel and contractors. The procedure should include the following: Full examination of alternative safer methods (e.g. cold cutting), other than hot work, before authorising hot work to take place. Regular reviews of completed permits to ensure compliance with the permit instructions and procedure. Insisting upon a hot work permit for any temporary operation involving open flame or sparks producing operation. This includes, but is not limited to: drilling, brazing, cutting, grinding, soldering, pipe thawing, heat applied roof coatings and welding. Only allowing competent persons trained in hot work to sign permits. Insisting that the checklist on the permit is completed, signed and adhered to. Prohibiting any hot work without a signed permit.

These lights can fail cascading hot and incandescent materials onto the products below and have been the cause of several large industrial fires.', action: 'Improve the lighting arrangements in the warehouse by: Lamps (including temporary lighting arrangements) in warehouses and storage areas must not be situated above combustible stock, but are to be positioned within aisles. Ideally lamps should be positioned a minimum of 2m from combustibles. Lamps should always be employed with the correctly fitting tempered or borosilicate glass barriers in place. All Metal Halide lamps should be operated in fully enclosed luminaries which are able to capture the broken parts after failure. Before retrofitting lamp containment barriers, it is essential that advice be taken from the luminaire manufacturers to ensure that this will not invalidate the approved standard for the fixture assembly and that fire safety will not be compromised. Where HID lamps are in continuous use they should be switched off for at least 15 minutes each week. Lamps which do not re-ignite following this "cycle-off" period must be replaced immediately.', client_response_prompt: 'Site Response', category: 'Special Hazards', default_priority: 3, is_active: true, scope: 'global' },

As such, in an incident this may not provide a good level of isolation if it is not tested.', action: 'As part of the site evacuation and emergency document, develop a plan that can be provided to the fire brigade upon arrival on site. The plan should be located either at the security gatehouse or the main fire alarm panel. The plan should identify: Electrical isolation points Gas shut off stop valve Hazardous materials storage and processes Any compressed gas storage or use Sprinklers Any other fixed fire protection services that might be of use to them, e.g. foam, gaseous systems etc. Location of firewater hydrant points Fire alarm zones Location of combustible composite panels Any plan should be reviewed periodically to reflect the business operation and configuration of plant and equipment A copy of the plan should be given to the local fire brigade and discussed during routine fire brigade visits.
