export const zoneDefinitionsText = `**Zone 0 / Zone 20**

An area in which an explosive gas atmosphere (Zone 0) or explosive dust atmosphere (Zone 20) is present continuously, or for long periods, or frequently. Equipment and protective systems for use in these areas must provide the highest level of safety and reliability. Only Category 1 equipment certified for Zone 0 or Zone 20 use may be installed. These areas typically include the interior of closed vessels, storage tanks, or processing equipment where flammable substances are continuously present.

**Zone 1 / Zone 21**

An area in which an explosive gas atmosphere (Zone 1) or explosive dust atmosphere (Zone 21) is likely to occur in normal operation occasionally. This classification applies to areas immediately surrounding Zone 0/20 areas, or where releases are expected during normal operational procedures such as sampling, maintenance, or routine equipment opening. Equipment for use in these zones must be Category 1 or Category 2, certified for Zone 1 or Zone 21. Examples include areas adjacent to flanges, valves, or process equipment where releases may occur during normal plant operation.

**Zone 2 / Zone 22**

An area in which an explosive gas atmosphere (Zone 2) or explosive dust atmosphere (Zone 22) is not likely to occur in normal operation but, if it does occur, will persist for a short period only. These zones are typically found surrounding Zone 1/21 areas as an additional safety margin, or in areas where releases are only credible under abnormal conditions such as equipment failure or process upset. Equipment suitable for Zone 2 or Zone 22 must be Category 1, 2, or 3. These areas require appropriate work permit systems and hot work controls but permit the use of normal industrial equipment in many cases.

**Non-Hazardous Areas**

Areas where explosive atmospheres are not expected to occur to an extent requiring special precautions. Standard industrial electrical and mechanical equipment may be used in these areas without additional ATEX certification. However, good practice requires that ignition sources are still controlled through appropriate systems of work, particularly when undertaking hot work or when flammable substances are temporarily introduced to the area.`;
